## üíª Run locally

If you want to run the project on your local machine, just follow the steps below:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Starting...

To get started, you simply need to clone the project repository on your machine and install the dependencies.

```
  git clone https://github.com/ludico1959/compassolisa
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements

Before installing the dependencies from the project, you need to have already installed on your machine:

* **Node.Js**: If you don't have it, just download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* **MongoDB**: If you don't have it, just download [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).*

*You don't necessary need to install MongoDB. It's possible to use a remote database through [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br/cloud/atlas/register).
MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-hosted MongoDB service on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. 


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting the environment variables

For using and accessing the MongoDB database, you must set the eenvironment variables. But don't worry, it's very easy. First, you need to choose if your database is local or remote. If it's local, you just have to create a **.env** file in the root of the API and copy and paste all the text in the **.env.example** file.

If your database is remote and it's hosted in MongoDB Atlas cloud, just change the environment variable called DATABASE_URL, in the **.env.example file.**, to the connection to your remote database. Then, just copy the text, create a **.env** file in the root of the API and paste the text there!

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Instaling dependencies

Open cmd.exe (if you are using Windows) or another command-line interpreter and enter the path of your project. Then just type the following instruction: 

```
npm install
```

By typing the statement above, it will automatically download all the dependencies listed in the package.json file inside the folder **node_modules**:

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Running the application

Well, now on the same cmd.exe screen (or another command-line interpreter), just start the server for the project to run locally typing:

```
node src/app/server.js
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Testing the application 
There are two options to test this API: 

#### üé® SWAGGER UI
The first one, using Swagger UI, is more user friendly. To use it, just type the following route in the seach bar of your favorite brownser!

```
http://localhost:3000/api/v1/api-docs/
```

#### üì¨ POSTMAN
The second one is using the Postman request collection from the repository to easily test the endpoints!
The file name is **postman_collection.json** and to use it, just download the Postman [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## üì° Run remotely

There is a new simple way to run the API. You can use a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) called **Heroku**. It allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. For using it, you just need access the following link below:
