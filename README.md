## üì¨ Testing the application on Postman

If you want to test the API's created in the project, first download the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
After downloading Postman, just follow the steps below to
be able to test the API!

## üíª Run locally

If you want to run the project on your local machine, just follow the steps below:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Starting...

To get started, you simply need to clone the project repository on your machine and install the dependencies.

```
  git clone https://github.com/ludico1959/compassolisa
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements

Before installing the dependencies from the project, you need to have already installed on your machine:

* **Node.Js**: If you don't have it, just download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* **MongoDB**: If you don't have it, just download [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Instaling dependencies

Open cmd.exe (if you are using Windows) or another command-line interpreter and enter the path of your project. Then just type the following instruction: 

```
npm install"
```

By typing the statement above, it will automatically download all the dependencies listed in the package.json file inside the folder **node_modules**:


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the application

Well, now on the same cmd.exe screen (or another command-line interpreter), just start the server for the project to run locally typing:

```
node src/app/server.js
```

Then you will need to open another terminal on your machine and start MongoDD. Just type the following command on the cmd.exe (or another command-line interpreter) screen:

```
mongod
```

If MongoDD is properly installed on your machine, it will start the service showing that port 27017 has been started.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing the application with Postman
Use the Postman request collection from the repository to easily test the endpoints!
